Deadlock:
-------------------
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, trying to obtain the lock from other thread which is
already in deadlock, locked by other thread.

Let's suppose there are two Threads T1, T2 and Locks L1, L2----

T1 - locked L1
T2 - locked L2
T1 waiting for L2 which is already locked by T2.
T2 waiting for L1 which is already locked by T1.

In the above situation,
T1 is waiting for T2 to release L2
T2 is waiting for T1 to release L1
causing Deadlock.

Condition for deadlock to occur,

1. Mutual Exclusion:
2. No preemption: Resources cannot be preempted(forcibly taken) from threads.
3. Hold and Wait: A thread holds at least one resource and waits for another.
4. Circular wait: A circular chain of threads exists, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

Deadlock prevention techniques:
--------------------------------
1. Lock ordering:
    Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order. If you make sure that all
    locks are always taken in the same order by any thread, deadlocks cannot occur

2. Time based locking: Release lock after timeout
